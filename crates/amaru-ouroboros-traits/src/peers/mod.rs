//! Peer-population observations shared by the network stack and consensus.
//!
//! A message is for work the receiver must act on immediately (which peer to ask next, which
//! chain to adopt, an adversarial disconnect). Population bookkeeping — who is connected, how
//! the bearer is used, sharing results, round-trip samples — is written here and read later.
//!
//! Callers pass the stage clock as [`ObservedAt`]. The resource does not read a wall clock.
