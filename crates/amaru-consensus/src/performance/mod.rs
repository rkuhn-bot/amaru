//! Shared performance resource: peer quality / availability and header lifecycle timings.
//!
//! [`PeerPerformance`] and [`HeaderPerformance`] are owned by a dedicated worker thread that
//! runs a Tokio `current_thread` runtime and pulls operations from an unbounded channel.
//! Stages record **events** via external effects constructed on [`Performance`], e.g.
//! `eff.external(Performance::record_header_announcement(...)).await`. Query effects await a
//! `tokio::sync::oneshot` reply (no blocking of multi-thread Tokio workers).
//!
//! Unit tests for peer/header logic should construct those types directly without spawning this
//! handle; the resource thread is only needed when exercising the effect path.
//!
//! Channel depth is monitored: WARN (rate-limited) when the queue exceeds normally expected
//! depth, ERROR + panic when it grows beyond reasonable bounds.
//!
//!
//! Stage-facing operations, who writes them, who reads them, and how urgent that read is.
//! Timeliness classes: C1 header propagation, C2 block fetch, C3 fetch when a peer is lost,
//! C4 chain selection, C5 adversarial disconnect, C7 keep-alive RTT, C8 peer-population
//! maintenance, C9 peer sharing. "Recorded immediately" means the stage enqueues and continues;
//! "awaited" means the stage waits for the worker before it continues; "on demand" means the
//! reader queries at its own decision.
